2 points: Elementary reasoning. It offers a simple explanation and conducts a basic analysis of the patient's specific situation.
3 points: Structured reasoning. It thoroughly analyzes the patient's symptoms and medical test results, performs preliminary differential diagnostics to rule out similar symptoms or manifestations, determines the patient's condition.
4 points: Systematic argumentation. The reasoning is relatively complete, taking into account the patient's symptoms, diagnostic information, and medical test results. Besides, medical literature is used to support the analysis, making the reasoning more credible and clinically valuable.
5 points: Advanced Reasoning. The reasoning is not limited to the information provided about the patient, but considers more possibilities, offering reasoning under a broader range of scenarios.

Since the patient's information may be incomplete, we place more emphasis on the diversity of analysis, and whether a wider range of scenarios have been considered.
